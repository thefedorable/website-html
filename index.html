        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a lot of things but I normally just introduce myself as a CS and 
          computer nerd. I love everything technology but I also love creating 
          stories. My dream is to one day be a video game devolper. The reason
          for this is because I want to be able to create world that people 
          get lost in for hours and hours. Worlds where people become so invested
          in the stories being told that every life or death situation feels
          real.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not doing all that you'll find me playing new video games,
          watching movies with friends, and honestly just being a pretty cool
          guy. I also really love Disneyland and it's the place that sparked
          my desire to tell stories. I may not be able to build an entire theme
          park but I can build a digital world where anything is possible!
